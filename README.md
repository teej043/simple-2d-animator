A rewrite of my old program "[TradnuxAnimator](http://tradnux.com/tradnux-2d-animator/)"

The old program was made in GameMaker 8.1, since then the game development software GameMaker has grown into a really powerful multiplatform authoring tool. TradnuxAnimator will now be rewritten in GameMaker Studio for lots of reason:

* GM Studio now has native support for json decode/encoding which can be an efficient data format for animation.
* The GM Studio YYC compiler produces a faster performing output product.
* Potential port other platforms other than Windows like MAC, Linux, HTML5 and possibly Android and iOS.
* General fixes on issues that older GameMaker versions has.
* Refactored GameMaker functions and new features that may help in the development.
